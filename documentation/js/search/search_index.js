Board\nDescription\nRevature's Strategic Initiatives Board is an application designed for business level and development level users to track facilitate and manage team based collaboration on community driven initiatives. This application will enable users to view all initiatives currently being developed. Strategic initiatives board will additionally allow users to create new initiatives and assign users to lead them. Strategic Initiatives Board will provide a space to opt into initiatives, and designate which developers are working on which initiatives. This application also provides a space to share brainstorming and progress reports on these initiatives.\nTechnologies Used\n\nAngular\nAngular Materials\nKarma\nJasmine\nHTML\nCSS\nJWT\nSpring Boot\nAWS EC2\nAWS S3\nAWS RDS\nDevOps\nSpring AOP\nSpring MVC\nSpring Test\nJava\nPostgreSQL\nJPA\nJUnit\nMockito\nSwagger\nSpring Framework\nSecurity and Access\n\nFeatures\n\nUsers can log in and view a list of iniatives\nUsers can create a new initiative\nUsers can join an initiative\nadmin can mark point of contact for initiative\nusers can upload documents to initiative (docx,csv,png,pdf)\nadmin can promote other users to admin status\n\nTo-Do List\n\nUpdate status of initiatives from active to inactive and complete\nFilter initiatives by state\nSign Up functionality \n\nUsage\nThis project was generated test with Angular CLI version 11.2.12.\nCloning Github Repo\nIt is recommended that developers work on their own fork. Fork the server and client repos from the original repos at this organization.   \nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\nContributors\nhttps://github.com/bkelly96\nhttps://github.com/KennethM1\nhttps://github.com/Phuc15\nhttps://github.com/vinayingalahalli\nhttps://github.com/michaeldkeyes\nhttps://github.com/MishaelHarrison\nhttps://github.com/GormTheWyrm\nhttps://github.com/Miloincome\nhttps://github.com/MHarris-hub\nhttps://github.com/Anthony-Tag\nhttps://github.com/alejandroOro99\nhttps://github.com/aadilowrevature \nLicense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
